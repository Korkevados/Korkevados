# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel  

### **4th-Year Data Science Student | ML & Systems Builder | Turning data into scalable, real-world products**

## 💫 About Me  
I’m a 4th-year Data Science student and a hands-on builder who loves creating systems end-to-end — from data pipelines and backend architecture to ML models and production-ready applications.  
I enjoy solving complex problems, researching new technologies, and turning ideas into real, working products.  

I'm currently working on:  
- 📈 **Horizon** — quantitative research and backtesting engines  
- 🧠 **ML projects** — LLM-powered tools, embeddings, analytics, and a full **13F network analysis project (final-year capstone)**  
- 🤖 **Self-learning** — currently studying **Reinforcement Learning** independently  

Always learning, always building.
